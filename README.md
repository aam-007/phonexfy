# Phonexfy
A program created which turns  spotify that is full of ads and banners (which are annoying) into an ad free experience.
The following files are virus free (no need to disable antivirus).

THESE FILES ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS.

Made with love at 2:50 AM

P.s. Spotify plz don't sue me



# Steps for installation

To block the ads follow these steps:

1. Download all the files on your computer

2. Run the file Installing the latest version of Spotify without ads.bat, which will install Spotify that contains an internal blocker that blocks some ads

3. Login to Spotify

4. Run the file Spotify installation review.bat that will check if the internal blocker was introduced in Spotify

5. Lastly, copy everything from the Host to block Spotify Ads.txt file, move the host file to the desktop from the directory: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc and paste the hosts from the text document.

 Ready!, you will have the ads blocked.
